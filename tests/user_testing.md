# User Testing Scenarios

This testing involves real users performing tasks to evaluate the application's usability and intuitiveness. The focus is on tasks and goals, not specific technical functions.

## Positive Scenarios (Tasks for the user to complete)

1.  **First-time User Onboarding:** "Welcome to PromptRanked. Please sign up for a new account and log in."
2.  **Finding a Challenge:** "Find the list of available challenges. Choose one that looks interesting to you."
3.  **Understanding a Challenge:** "Read the description of the challenge you selected. Can you explain what you need to do to solve it?"
4.  **Submitting a First Attempt:** "Now, try to solve the challenge. Enter your prompt in the text box and submit it."
5.  **Viewing Feedback:** "What happened after you submitted your prompt? Was the feedback clear?"
6.  **Finding Your Profile:** "After attempting a challenge, find your personal profile page."
7.  **Checking Your Score:** "On your profile page, can you find your total score and a list of the challenges you've attempted?"
8.  **Exploring the Leaderboard:** "Navigate to the leaderboard. Can you find your own username on the list?"
9.  **Changing Profile Information:** "Go to your account settings and try to change your bio or username."
10. **Logging Out:** "When you are finished, please log out of your account."

## Negative Scenarios (Observing user behavior in difficult situations)

1.  **Ambiguous Challenge Instructions:** Give the user a challenge with deliberately unclear instructions. "Can you figure out what to do here? What's confusing?"
2.  **Incorrect Login Attempt:** "Imagine you forgot your password. Try to log in with the wrong password. What happens? Is it clear what you should do next?"
3.  **Invalid Registration Data:** "Try to sign up with an email address that is obviously incorrect (e.g., 'hello'). What does the system tell you?"
4.  **Finding a Non-Existent Feature:** "Can you find a way to direct message another user on the leaderboard?" (A feature that doesn't exist). Observe how they search for it and what they do when they can't find it.
5.  **Interpreting Failure:** After a user submits an incorrect prompt, ask: "Why do you think your prompt was marked as incorrect? What would you do next?"
6.  **Navigation Dead-End:** Have the user navigate to a page and then remove the primary navigation (via developer tools). "How would you get back to the homepage from here?"
7.  **Encountering an Error Message:** Show the user a generic error page (e.g., "Error 500"). "What do you think this means? What would you do now?"
8.  **Losing Work:** Have the user type a long prompt into the submission box, then simulate a browser refresh. "Your work wasn't saved. How does that make you feel? What would you expect to happen?"
9.  **Confusing UI Element:** Point to a non-standard icon or a button with ambiguous text. "What do you think this button does?"
10. **Mobile Usability Challenge:** Ask the user to perform a key task (like submitting a long prompt) on a small mobile screen. "How was that experience? Was anything difficult to do?"
